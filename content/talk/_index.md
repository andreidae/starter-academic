title: Genética y su aplicación en ecolgía evolutiva. Una visión a través del
  estudio de mamíferos marinos
abstract: Studies of evolutionary ecology using genetics and other biomolecules
  have come a long way—from using allozymes and short sequences of mitochondrial
  or nuclear DNA to the assembly of full nuclear genomes and characterization of
  proteins and lipids. It has also come from using only contemporary samples to
  samples dating back thousands of years, and to retrieving data from indirect
  environmental sources like water or sediments. Here I will talk on how the use
  of genetic methods have profoundly deepened our understanding of the origin of
  marine mammals, their adaptation and speciation processes, as well as past
  population changes, migrations and admixtures that gave rise to the current
  diversity.
